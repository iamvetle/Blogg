# Things I want to implement into my Blogg project

There are stuff I want the web client to be able to do, that I have not yet implemented. There are also things I want my blogg application to be able to do.

I am focusing on **frontend** at the moment.

## Backend

### models.py

- **CustomUser** ->
  - [ ] new field: profile picture upload / img upload
- [ ] Make it possible to save images in code editor to database here
  - Find out how to do this
- [x] Make a '**tag**' model and connect to the '**post**' model through a manytomany field on
- [x] **Tag** : new model. Create a new 'tag' model and connect it to CustomUser (and or post?)
- [x] **Categories** : new model. Connect to CustomUser (or post?)
- [ ] Make it so users can **save posts** for reading later. Might need another model for that
- (Do I need a new field in models.py? Does it need to be connected to a user?)

- [ ] Make the api return '**following**'

(I want users to be able to 'like' other posts.
(Share? - much later in project at least))

## Frontend

> Try to use 'red (fail), green (barely work), refactor (work)' - TTD

- [x] Render the created posts in '[id]' with propper html. So it can actually display each post correctly.
- [ ] Fjern 'searchRequest' og 'searchPagnation' (det som er igjen)

### [id] user page

- [ ] Pengj√∏re veldig og rydd opp.
- [ ] Fjern spor av tidligere prop og slett den gamle component.

---

### min-side

- [ ] Change the **personal posts** that are received in 'min-side' to be snippets
- [ ] Put pagnation there if the users have a lot of posts
- [ ] Give users the ability to edit their own posts

---

### index

- [x] The post snippets **renders the elements** \<h1\> and such which they are not supposed to do. Fix that.
  - But far from perfect!!
- [x] Place a temperary profile picture in the user sidebar (the same on as in min-side)
- [x] There is a '**date_published**' problem that interfers with ordering that I need to fix.
  - [x] Split '**aside**' from 'ListArticles', so it becomes two components instead.

### text editor

- [x] When **_making a post_** I want the styling to be the same
  - [x] Also the width. So when creating the post it looks like it will be rendered.
- [ ] The **posting functionality** i want it to be obvious when a post was SUCCESSFULL, or when it FAILED.
- Make it possible for the user to **add pictures** when making post
  - I don't want to focus on adding and rendering images until later
- Maybe remove 'title' input field and just use 'content'

---

### General

- [ ] Expand the registration form to include more information options
- [ ] Fix the emit between new post and editorcard when it comes to border color and such

### thoughts

There are features I generally want to implement, but not sure how.

- Comments have no functionality right now

- Text editor for publishing posts
- maybe relevant [simplemde](https://simplemde.com/)

Not so important right now:

- Make the loading, and **_lazyloading_** much better

- [ ] Find out how I want implement "**text editor**"
- Should I continue with **TiptapEditor** or use something else like **simplemde**?
- Should I remove the images that are listed on the feed/index
