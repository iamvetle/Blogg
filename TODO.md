Things I want to implement into my Blogg project
================================================

There are stuff I want the web client to be able to do, that I have not yet implemented. There are also things I want my blogg application to be able to do.

## Backend

### models.py
* **CustomUser** -> new field: profile picture upload / img upload
* Make a '**tag**' model and connect to the '**post**' model through a manytomany field on
* Find out how I can create an option to 'save article'
* * Do I need a new field in models.py? Does it need to be connected to a user?

## Frontend
>Try to use 'red (fail), green (barely work), refactor (work)' - TTD
* Remove some old pages and components that are not in use
* Expand the registration form to include more information options
* Make the loading, and *lazyloading* much better
* * Make the api return 'following'
